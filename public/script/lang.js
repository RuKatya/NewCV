I decided to study medical systems management and afterwards continue on to nursing. It took time to understand that taking care of patients is too much responsibility for me, whilst studying for my degree programing courses made much more sense and aroused my interest. Even though it was clear I wouldn't work in the medical sphere after graduating, I kept on studying until I finished my BA in order to have a profession in the future.",

While exploring different languages, I felt empowered, observing the code turning from nothing to something beneficial. It got me excited. Subsequently, Javascript encouraged me to become a web developer. A combination of CSS, HTML and more can provide a seamless experience to a user through the browser. Finally, I decided to turn it into a career; that’s why you are reading my CV."
