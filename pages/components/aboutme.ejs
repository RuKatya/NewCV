                <p>
                    All my life I was confident that I wanted to work in a medical
                    field. I thought about studying physiotherapy or nursing. I decided to
                    study
                    medical systems management and afterwards
                    continue on to
                    nursing. It took time to understand that taking care of patients
                    is too
                    much
                    responsibility
                    for
                    me,
                    whilst studying for my degree programing courses made much more
                    sense
                    and
                    aroused my
                    interest.
                    Even
                    though it was clear I wouldn't work in the medical sphere after
                    graduating, I
                    kept
                    on
                    studying
                    until I
                    finished my BA in order to have a profession in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After graduating, I undertook several courses from YouTube and
                    paid
                    courses in
                    C,
                    Java.
                    While
                    exploring
                    different languages, I felt empowered, observing the code
                    turning from
                    nothing
                    to
                    something
                    beneficial.
                    It got me excited. Subsequently, Javascript encouraged me to
                    become a
                    web
                    developer.
                    A
                    combination of
                    CSS, HTML and more can provide a seamless experience to a user
                    through
                    the
                    browser.
                    Finally,
                    I
                    decided
                    to turn it into a career; thatâ€™s why you are reading my CV.
