<h2 style="color: rgb(76, 76, 155);">About the project</h2>
I built the page using EJS, which allows you to build components and put them together when and where you need.
In addition, I used an animation library, by which you can show details in an interesting and unusual way.
To make the page easy to use, I added jQuery, for automatically scrolled to wherever you want at the touch of a button.
